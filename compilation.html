            <p>Comparing C# vs Python
                1. C# vs Python: Speed
                When we talk about speed, here, we mean your speed, not the program’s speed (we’ll get to that in performance). To start, Python was designed to be coded. That might sound odd (as all languages are meant to be coded), but Python really takes the programmer into account. Python has a lot of white space and easy readability. 
                It also has a much simpler syntax than C#. For example, printing out your name in C# takes around ten lines of code. The same task can be accomplished in two with Python. Also, Python doesn’t require you to end every line with a semicolon as C languages do. 
                The differences are mostly small things, but they are a huge help when writing code.
                On the flip-side, C# is familiar. If you know Java or any other C language then learning C# is only a step to the left. While Python operates on many similar structural principles—Like being object-oriented and a high-level language—the syntax is a lot different than C# or other C languages. If you’re not familiar with Python, its syntax might slow you down as you learn it.
